    <h3>Tips and Variations</h3>
    <p><b>Tip 1:</b> After Stirring in the Rice, cover the pot with a tight lid. This needs to be done because Jollof Rice needs a lot of steam to turn out right</p>
    <p><b>Tip 2:</b> The amount of time your blended peppers need to be heated before you add seasoning depends on how much water was in it before it was put on the fire. The more the initial water in it, the longer it has to stay on the fire before seasoning can be added</p>
    <p><b>Variation:</b> The Chicken stock can be replaced with either a Beef or Vegetable stock</p>
